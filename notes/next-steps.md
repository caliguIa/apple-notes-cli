# Apple Notes Format Research - Next Steps

## 1. Current Focus: Checklist Investigation

### 1.1 State Transition Tests
```markdown
C2A: Unchecked to Checked
- Capture initial state
- Capture after check

C2B: Checked to Unchecked
- Capture initial state
- Capture after uncheck

C2C: Multiple Transitions
- Capture initial unchecked
- Capture after first check
- Capture after uncheck
- Capture after second check
```

### 1.2 Analysis Goals
1. Track field 4 structure changes
2. Map field 5.5 metadata patterns
3. Document binary data variations
4. Understand state preservation

## 2. Immediate Next Steps
1. Run state transition tests
2. Analyze checklist metadata patterns
3. Map correlation between states and binary data
4. Document checklist format structure

## 3. Future Investigation Areas
1. Field 4 varying values significance
2. Field 2.1/2.2 purpose
3. Format position calculation patterns
4. Metadata relationship mapping

## 4. Required Test Results
1. Checklist state transitions (C2A-C)
2. Additional format interaction tests
3. Edge case validations
4. Binary data pattern verification

To continue this research:
1. Execute checklist state transition tests
2. Compare field 4 and field 5 structures across states
3. Document patterns in binary data
4. Map metadata relationships

Key focus should be on understanding the relationship between checklist states and metadata structures, particularly the field 5.5 patterns and their correlation with field 4 values.
